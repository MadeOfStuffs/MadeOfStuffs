      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>I started my 3D printing journey in 2014 after a conversation with a professor at the college I attended. This led us to acquire a 3D printer and begin testing. Within a year, we had established the world's largest print farm at the time and developed blueprints for a college-level 3D printing course. I continued 3D printing as a hobby until 2022, when I decided to go professional.</p>
      <h3>Mission and Values</h3>
      <p>My mission is to use 3D printing to help businesses save money and expedite slower processes. I aim to make 3D printing more accessible and easy to understand for both businesses and consumers.</p>
      <h3>Unique Selling Points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rapid prototyping allows companies to test components quickly.</li>
        <li>Quick turnaround times and the ability to rapidly iterate.</li>
        <li>Test fitting and operational parts can be produced quickly, keeping production on track.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
        <p>With 3D printing, you can rapidly test and iterate new designs and materials in a production environment. This technology enables the verification of a design's fit, function, and manufacturability before committing to full-scale production.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Custom 3D Printing</h3>
        <p>3D printing offers limitless possibilities for customization. From concept models—such as an architect 3D printing a detailed miniature of an estate building project—to everyday items like toothbrush holders, headphone or cellphone stands, and even custom business cards or badges, 3D printing can bring any concept to life.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Design Support</h3>
        <p>Our design support services include collaboration with professional 3D modelers to help bring your ideas to fruition. Whether you need assistance with initial concept design, optimization for manufacturability, or final adjustments, our expert team is here to guide you through the process.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Production Runs</h3>
        <p>3D printing enables the production of both bespoke pieces and large quantities of components without the need for extensive tooling or expensive machine add-ons. This flexibility makes it an ideal solution for everything from one-off custom parts to thousands of units.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Industries Served</h3>
        <p>While we currently specialize in serving the aerospace industry, our goal is to expand our services to a diverse range of industries. We are committed to providing innovative 3D printing solutions across various sectors in the future.</p>
